# Arcade-Lab

If you want to run this code first you need to start server.py code first. Right now, all the codes for Husky control are commented on so that you can just test with drones. 

In order to also run and test husky control, you need to uncomment all the husky code in the server.py (lines 20, 24, 219-257)

After running the server, go to the Frontend/frontend folder and run "npm start," and the webpage will pop up.
